## 1.B Getting the styles and fonts
All the existing files and styles can be found at:

> [!caution] Heads up:
> You'll need existing access to see the files and folders, but not for the file lines below in 1.B.1 and 1.B.2.
### 1.B.1 Graphic Styles
1. The styles are saved in a graphic styles library. Download the file - [JBHUX.Mascots.GraphicStyles.ai](https://jbhunt.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/ux/EU6BHlfn0Q1HhXy-Cer5x0EBB1mk2HSlUDNCgjxfjykDVQ?e=xnvdEY).
2. Click `Window > Graphic Styles` to open the graphic styles panel. 
3. Then click the `more options` icon. 
4. Choose `Open Graphic Styles Library > Other Library`.
5. From the finder window, choose the graphic styles that you just downloaded. 
### 1.B.2 Color pallet 
1. The colors have been saved into a pallet. Download the file - [JBHUX.Mascots.Color.ai](https://jbhunt.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/ux/EVOLqEVLHCFJnW3Y-GkNuakBTYPYeeuCaV1k9WmT1q7fQg?e=lyndFh). 
2. Click `Window > Swatches` to open the swatch panel. 
3. Click the `more options` icon
4. Choose `Open Swatch Library > Other Library`.
5. From the finder window, choose the graphic styles you just downloaded. 

> [!info] Tip:
> When you click `Window`, if you see a check next to the panel you're trying to open, that means it's already open. Clicking it will close the panel. 

### 1.B.3 Install the fonts
1. Go to [fonts.adobe.com](fonts.adobe.com). Sign in with the account you're using Illustrator with so the fonts sync. 
2. The name font is a marker font called [Blambot FX Heavy BB](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/blambot-fx). 
3. The script font for "The" is called [Bell Script Pro Regular](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/bello).
4. Install any adobe font by clicking the `Add Family` button at the top right of the font page. 
   ![[ai.02.png]]
6. Once added and synced the fonts will show in your Character panel. 
## 1.C Getting the styles
Now that we've got a the styles, colors, and fonts set up, let's grab the templates. 
1. Download and open the [JBHUX.Mascots.ai](https://jbhunt.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/ux/EZ-JIlxehdxJvdhfUaFCNAMB3lH-JNba7Gux8-XWpNwxDg?e=pbC02V) file.  
2. Choose a color scheme to work with. 
3. Copy the circle and paste it into your new document. 
4. Copy the typography and paste them into your document. 
5. Copy the mascot illustration you'll be using into the new document. 
We're ready to build a new logo. 
# 2. Assembling the logo

> [!caution] Heads up:
> Things will go much faster if you learn to use the [keyboard shortcuts](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/default-keyboard-shortcuts.html). 

Now that we have all the parts, we might need to prep the mascot illustration. If this is a purchased illustration it's common that it'll need to be ungrouped and sometimes flattened. If you don't need to do these things, skip ahead. 
## 2.A Prepping the Illustration. 
Because of the process the Illustration can't have any boxes around it. It also needs to be as simple as possible.
1. Duplicate the illustration by copying and pasting or holding down `option/alt` and dragging it. Duplicating is important because you don't want to destroy your original object. We can delete it when we're done. 
2. Click the mascot group and use `Cmd/Ctr+Shift+G` or `Object > Ungroup` to ungroup it. You might not notice a difference at first. However, if you've ungrouped the object you can click parts of it individually. You may need to ungroup several times. 
3. Remove shadows, backgrounds, and any unwanted objects. 
4. Select the mascot and use use `Cmd/Ctr+G` or `Object > Group` to group it. 

>[!info] Bonus:
>The mascots support a headshot, full body, and both of those with text lockups as well as text lockups alone. If you can isolate the head and body at this stage you can do that. 

Now we're ready to assemble everything. 

> [!caution] Heads up:
> **DON'T FORGET TO SAVE!** Illustrator crashes often. 
## 2.B Add titles
The text is easy. If you've copied from the source document the text will have graphic styles and warp effects applied to it. It's ready to be changed and combined. 
1. Add the title to the name. 
2. Align the "The" so that it fits the letters. We'll adjust this later to also fit the Illustration. 
> [!caution] Heads up:
> It's considered bad design to use all caps with a script font. Try using title case. If that doesn't work for what you're doing, change the script font to Blambot FX Heavy BB. 
## 2.C Assembling the pieces
If you're following along, you should have four parts and it should look something like this:
1. Background Circle
2. Illustration 
3. Title
4. "The" or label
![[ai.03.png]]
---
1. Scale the illustration to fit into the circle but overlap slightly. This causes visual interest by breaking the border of the circle. 
2. Select the illustration and the circle and align the centers both vertically and horizontally using the align panel. `Window > Align`
   ![[ai.05.png]]
3. Select the title text. Ensure it's the top most layer by bring it to the front with the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Cmd+]` or  `Object > Arange > Bring to front`. 
4. Arrange the title so that it overlaps the illustration and circle. Drag to select the title, illustration and circle. Then align their vertical centers. 
5. Select the "The" and bring it to the front. Then send it back one step with the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+[` or `Object > Arange > Send backward`. The "The" should be one layer behind the title now. 
6. Arrange the "The" so that it sits slightly behind the Title and slightly overlaps the circle.

Congratulations. The pieces are all in place and now we can apply the final inline/outline effect. 
# 3. Inline/Outline Effect 
The inline/outline effect was a staple I learned making t-shirts early in my career. It helps provide a sense of depth to the design. I also like to use it to create a single solid outline. This gives the logo the feeling of a sticker. 

> [!caution] Heads up:
> It's often easier to do this process to the pieces before assembling them. This process works for all the parts, however and so I saved it for last. 

1. Select the design and duplicate it by pressing `option` and dragging it or copying and pasting it. 
2. On the copy, select the title text and use the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Cmd+O` or `Type>Create Outlines` to create outlines of the text. This converts the text from text to vector objects. 
3. Copy the title with `Cmd+C` and then use `Cmd+F` or `Edit>Paste in front` to paste the title in place and on top of everything else. 
4. Flatten the pasted title by clicking `Object > Expand Apperance` and then `Opject > Flatten Transparancy`. This will convert all strokes to vector styles and permanently apply all effects. Finally, use the Unite tool in the pathfinder panel to combine all the flattened objects into a single object. You should see all the blue lines disappear and it should be a single color.

5. With the flattened title selected, choose the `Background Outline` from the `JBHUX.Mascots.GraphicStyles` Graphic Styles library. This will apply the outline effect. 
6. Using the same process as above, flatten it. 
7. Send the outline to the back with the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Cmd+[` or `Object > Arrange > Send to back`. This puts the outline behind everything. 
8. Repeat this process for the "The" and the Illustration. Then play with the layers to get the arrangement that looks best. 
9. When satisfied, drag and select all the object and use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+G` or `Object>Group` to group the mascots. 
The end.

>[!caution] Heads up:
>It's often good to keep an editable version of your text for later. You can create a new layer and cut and paste your finished mascot there. Then, toggle off the working background layer.
