## Template Explanations 
### Note Templates:
#### Article: 
This is a template for articles found on the internet.

This is a template for books. I use it as a "parent" note for the book. I then use the chapter template for each chapter. I come back to the parent book note and add specific callouts to each chapter. 

#### Chapter:
This is a template for taking notes within a book. 

#### Daily Study:
This is my daily journal and Bible study template. 

#### Guitar Song:
This is a template for guitar songs. I use Affinity Publisher to print songs to have offline. To make this easier I use the code block for the lyrics with chords over them. Same for TABs. For chords and some TABs I just the jTab plugin.

This is the template that I paste into the Kindle Sync pulgin's template area.
